        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This is a test website for a project, The first three pages are written only using Html and Css , you can
            also visit the other pages using the categories blow
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="categories">
        <h2>Categories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Categories/bootStrap/bootstrap.php"> BootStrap </a></li>
            <li><a href="Categories/Jquery/Jquery.html"> Jquery </a></li>
            <li><a href="Categories/game/GameStart.html"> MiniGame </a></li>
            <li><a href="Categories/startbootstrap-landing-page-gh-pages/index.html"> BootStrap2 </a></li>
            <li><a href="Categories/php/php.php"> PHP </a></li>

    <div class="block">
        <h3>Note 1</h3>
        <p>As this is only a test website , I haven't put much effort on the design , however you can check out the
            pages in different sizes as it is a fully responsive website allowing you to see the contents on different
            platforms
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
        <h3>Note 2</h3>
        <p>The categories are the most important parts of the website and as I continue learning how to code , I will
            add new sections to that part . As you already know this page is written only using simple Css and Html but the
            other pages that you'll visit in the categories are written using different Libraries or programming languages.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
        <h3>Note 3</h3>
        <p>There's actually not such thing as "note 3" , I only made this part to show how the responsive layouts work.
